# About this Project

This is a simple ecommerce page, where you can add and remove products to cart. The products of this page come from an api, link below:

<a href="https://mks-frontend-challenge-api.herokuapp.com/api-docs/">Link of the api</a>

The deployment of the aplication was made to vercel, link below:

<a href="http://mks-front-end-challenge.vercel.app/">Link of deployment</a>

This is a project made with next js, typescript, styled-components and redux tool kit (for state management), and also some test were made using jest. Besides that, it was used shimmer skeleton for loading. 

To run the tests use the command below:
```
yarn run test
```

The project was made for a technical test for a front end job.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
